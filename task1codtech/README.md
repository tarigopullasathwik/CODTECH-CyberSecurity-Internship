# File Integrity Checker

This project is part of the CODTECH Cyber Security Internship (Task 1).

## Objective
To monitor file integrity by calculating and comparing SHA-256 hash values.

## Tools Used
- Python
- hashlib library

## How It Works
1. Generates a SHA-256 hash of a file
2. Stores the hash securely
3. Re-checks the file later
4. Alerts if the file is modified

## Usage
Run the script and choose:
- Option 1 to store hash
- Option 2 to check file integrity

## Outcome
Detects unauthorized or accidental file changes.

Test change
